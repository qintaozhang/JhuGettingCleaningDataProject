## Class Project(week4) for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

**Steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file.
3. Set work directory to root directory of unziped file (my code hided my setwd :)):

**Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).** 

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidyMean.csv],which was saved in the work directory.**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
